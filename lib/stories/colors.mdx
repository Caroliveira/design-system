# Customizing Colors with Our Theme Provider

Our design system is built with flexibility in mind, allowing for the customization of colors to fit a wide range of branding and aesthetic preferences. Through our `Theme Provider`, users can easily adapt the default color scheme to align with their unique brand identity, ensuring consistency and coherence across designs.

To customize the color palette, including brand colors, grayscale, and semantic colors, refer to our theme provider documentation. The theme provider offers a straightforward way to apply custom colors across your application, ensuring that your design remains consistent with your brand's visual identity.

## Simplifying Theme Customization with CSS Variables

In addition to direct color customization, our design system simplifies theme adaptation through predefined CSS variables. These variables, such as `--primary-background-color`, `--secondary-background-color`, `--primary-text-color`, and others, automatically adjust according to the selected theme (light or dark). This setup aligns with the usage guidelines outlined for our color palette, ensuring that applications automatically adapt to theme changes with minimal effort.

By incorporating these variables in your CSS, your application's appearance will seamlessly transition between themes, maintaining both consistency and accessibility. This dynamic theming capability empowers developers to create flexible, visually appealing applications that align with both user preferences and brand identity.

For detailed instructions on implementing theme changes, utilizing CSS variables for dynamic theming, and customizing colors within our design system, please see our [Theme Documentation](?path=/docs/system-theme--docs).
