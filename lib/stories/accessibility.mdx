# Accessibility Guidelines

We are committed to ensuring that our digital products are usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. This document outlines the principles, tools, and practices we follow and recommend to achieve web accessibility.

## Introduction

Accessibility is not a feature; it's a fundamental aspect of good web design. Our design system embraces accessibility principles from the ground up, ensuring that the components and themes we provide support creating inclusive experiences for all users.

## Designing for Accessibility

When designing digital experiences, it's crucial to consider a wide range of users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. Here are some general principles to keep in mind:

- **Use sufficient color contrast:** Text should stand out clearly against its background.
- **Employ semantic HTML:** Proper use of HTML elements ensures correct structure and interpretation by assistive technologies.
- **Ensure keyboard navigability:** Interactive elements must be usable with a keyboard alone.

## Color and Contrast

### Tools for Color Schemes

Creating an accessible color scheme is pivotal in designing inclusive products. We recommend using tools like [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to generate color palettes that complement each other well and adhere to accessibility standards.

### Contrast Checking Tools

Once you have a color scheme, it's essential to ensure it meets the minimum contrast ratios required for accessibility. Tools like [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) provide an easy way to test the contrast between text and its background, helping you adjust colors to meet or exceed the recommended ratios.

## Semantic HTML

Using semantic HTML ensures that your content structure is meaningful for both users and search engines. It plays a crucial role in accessibility, as it allows screen readers and other assistive technologies to correctly interpret and navigate through your site.

## Keyboard Navigation

Ensure your site can be fully navigated using a keyboard alone. This includes providing focus indicators for interactive elements and ensuring custom widgets are keyboard accessible.

## Screen Reader Testing

Regular testing with screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver is essential to identify and fix accessibility issues, ensuring your digital products are accessible to users who rely on these technologies.

## Additional Resources

For further guidance on accessibility standards and practices, explore the following:

- [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
- [A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/)

Adhering to these guidelines and using recommended tools will help ensure your projects are not only accessible but also inclusive and compliant with international accessibility standards.
