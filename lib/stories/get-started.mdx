# Getting Started with Lina's Design System

Welcome to Lina's DS! This compact toolkit is the result of Lina's efforts to standardize UI components for personal projects. While still in its early stages, the design system aims to simplify the development of visually cohesive and accessible web experiences. It features a dynamic theming engine that ensures consistency across light and dark modes, designed with adaptability and user preferences in mind.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive in, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- An awesome React project that might need our help.

**Note**: TypeScript is supported and recommended for an enhanced development experience, but it's entirely optional.

## Installation

Start by adding the design system to your project. You can install it using npm or yarn, depending on your preference. Open your terminal and run one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @linaoliveira/design-system

# Using yarn
yarn add @linaoliveira/design-system
```

## Usage

### 1. Theme Provider Setup

Critical for the functionality of our design system, the `ThemeProvider` must envelop your application to apply consistent styling across components. Without this, components will not function as intended, missing out on styles and themes.

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from "@linaoliveira/design-system";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      {/* Your application components, pages or routes go here */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

### 2. Using Components

Begin incorporating design system components into your UI. As the system evolves, more components will become available. Here's a Button component example:

```js
import { Button } from "@linaoliveira/design-system";

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Button color="error" variant="outlined">
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
};
```

### 3. Using CSS Variables

Utilize the design system's CSS variables for effortless theme switching. For a comprehensive list of available CSS variables and how to use them, refer to our [Theming Guide](?path=/docs/system-theme--docs#css-variables-for-theme-adaptation).

```css
body {
  background-color: var(--primary-background-color);
  color: var(--primary-text-color);
}
```

## Advanced Usage

For more advanced usage, including creating custom components, overriding styles, and leveraging the full power of the design system, visit our documentation portal. Here you will find comprehensive guides, API references, and best practices:

- **Components Documentation:** Explore the detailed documentation for each component, including props, usage examples, and design guidelines.

- **[Theming Guide](?path=/docs/system-theme--docs):** Learn how to customize and apply themes to tailor the design system to your brand.

- **[Accessibility Guidelines](?path=/docs/system-accessibility--docs):** Understand how to use the design system to create accessible and inclusive digital experiences.

## Examples

For practical examples of how to implement and customize the design system, you can check [lina's portfolio code](https://github.com/Caroliveira/portfolio) where is using the existing components. For more example on how to disable themes and change colors, they are still to come.
